.description
A program to fit straight lines, polynomes and exponentional curves to sets
of points.  Can fit to polynomes of degree of 16 and lower.  Calculated
coefficients can be printed and saved.  A graph of the points and curve can
be shown (in any screen resolution), printed and saved as an IFF file.
Supports localization.  Binary only.
