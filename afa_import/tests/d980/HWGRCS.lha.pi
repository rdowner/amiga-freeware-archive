GNU Revision Control Sys 5.6pl8 (1 of 3)
.description
A three part distribution of an RCS 5.6.0.1 port to the Amiga, currently at
patch level 8.  Part 1 contains the executables and documentation in
AmigaGuide and "man" format, part 2 contains the source code to RCS, and
part 3 contains the source code and binaries for patch and diffutils.

The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of text files.
RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging, identification, and merging
of revisions.  RCS is useful for text that is revised frequently.  For
example: programs, documentation, graphics, papers, form letters, etc.
Included are RCS 5.6, GNU diffutils 2.6 and an LP utility to support paged
diff outputs.
